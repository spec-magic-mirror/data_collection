For "mole_labeler.py":

Make sure all images are in a directory called "images" (images not included in this repo)

This has the following capabilities:
* User can click any number of moles on each image to store each as a separate mole
* Stores results in a .csv file
* Progress can be resumed if the user quits early so labeling can be done in multiple sittings

The input to the script is a results csv filename (with the .csv). The format of this file is a list of [imagename, x, y] that is updated at the end of each labeling session.

NOTE: End your session as specified below (not using Ctrl+Z) to make sure the data is recorded!

When you want to start or continue a labeling session:
1. Run as "python mole_labeler.py <results_filename>"
2. Click into the window once to bring it into "focus" (otherwise the first click isn't recorded)
3. Click each mole in the image
4. Type "n" to go to the next image

When you want to end the current labeling session:
1. Type "q" to quit
2. The data will then be recorded to the filename you specified and the script will end
3. To continue your session, follow the above instructions and be sure to use the same filename. This will automatically resume from the first unseen image.
